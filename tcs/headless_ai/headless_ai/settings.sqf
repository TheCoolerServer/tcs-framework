This module enables live spawning of arrays including AI and objects on the HC machine locally.
It is designed to spawn HC locally in order to improve performance, as well as enabling the
option of having randomized enemy composition, size, etc, or to allow for live spawning
of reinforcements or subsequent AOs.
